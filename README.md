## OSTEP Homework and Projects
This is a place for the homework and projects for the Operating System in Three Easy Pieces course. I've divided the repo into two top-level directories, one for homework and one for project.

### Homework
Within the homework section, each folder corresponds to a chapter. Some chapters do not have homework questions or code to write and so some chapter numbers might appear to be missing. Each chapter has a `homework.md` file where I've copied the questions from the text and put my answers below. I've also borrowed the scripts from the [course site](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-homework) so everything is centralized.

### Projects
In addition to course homework, there are also larger projects to be done. The suggestions are available [here](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects). I've borrowed the test runner from Remzi's repository and copied it locally. More instructions on how to run it are available in the [README](./projects/tester/README.md). For each project, I've also copied the tests. Running tests requires navigating to the specific project and running the relevant shell script, which needs to be updated to point to the `run-tests-sh` script in `tester`.

### Contributions
I just want to thank Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau and the University of Wisconsin-Madison for putting this exceptionally high quality course completely free online. I've bought the book and the PDF and would have gladly spent more money on it if asked. It is really top-notch.
